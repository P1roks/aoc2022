# Day 7
I saw this one and went: "Oh it will probably use some self referential structure so I'm not gonna use Rust for it. And what other performent language do I know? C++ of course so let's use it along with its C++20 features" and boy lemme tell you it was a mistake. C++20's ranges api, albeit really cool is poorly documentented (on cppreference that is) and also I did a mistake of modelling a complex structure which was an overkill for this day, but I don't really have any regrets about solving it that way because solutions to these problems should be mainly fun and fun it kinda was (C++ can never be 100% fun with all its segfaults and the likes). To solve this one I just parse the input file to a Node struct, where each node holds a pointer to its parent and its children, then recursively visit all nodes from the base node and voila - solutions to both parts work
