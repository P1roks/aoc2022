# Day 21
This one was real fun to solve. Part 1 was really easy - just parsing all monkeys dividing them into 2 groups - those which are solved and those which still await their child monkeys to be solved, then looping endlessly until the big monkey - root is solved and displaying it. Part 2, however, was when this one became fun - you now had to reverse the order of operations because the root monkey now compared its 2 children and one of them, somewhere deep inside had a monkey that was really you. Had to first find path to this monkey from root, then calculate all monkeys that weren't related to that monkey, and the reverse operations performed so that you could get the number needed to make 2 root children equal. Sounds easy? Well, now that I laid everything it kinda is - but rest assured that figuring all this out alone was kinda painful especially when it turned out that when monkey realted to your monkey was on the right side of minus sign the reversing of operations didn't require just plain old switching to opposite operations but actual (not very hard, mind you, but tricky to figure out for a tired brain) math
